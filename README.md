# D3 Bullet Chart Extension
Qlik Sense Extension for Dimensional Bullet Charts using D3

## Project Description

This project intends to provide an interactive bullet chart using D3 that allows the user to visualize data across a dimension.  The linear gauge chart in Qlik Sense allows for some of the same functionality but does not allow the user to create a bar for each dimension.


## Installation Instructions

To use this extension, place the 'D3 Bullet Chart' folder in the directory C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Documents\Qlik\Sense\Extensions.  Launch Qlik Sense and open an app, edit the app, and drag the 'D3 Bullet Chart' Chart Object into the sheet where you'd like it to appear. Add a dimension (optional) and at least one measure. 

To use the sample application included with the extension, copy the file 'D3 Bullet Chart Sample App.qvf' into the directory C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Documents\Qlik\Sense\Apps then the application will appear in your Qlik Sense Hub.

Have fun!

# Extension Information

This extension was developed using a D3 example for bullet charts as a base.  However, this extension allows you to add a dimension that will create multiple bullet charts within a single extension.
